This file will be my notes file. You will be able to see the process I go through to learn C++. I'm starting from scratch, with absolutely no background in this language. My only coding knowledge at the moment is C (and a bit of web)!

So let's get started :)

<h2> .cpp & .hpp <h2>

Typically C++ source code files are given the suffix:

.cpp (ex: hello.cpp) or
.hpp (ex: hello.hpp)

In the .cpp you will put your functions and in the .hpp the Class declarations.


<h2> Compilation & Execution <h2>

C++ is a compiled language. That means that to get a program to run, you must first translate it from the human-readable form to something a machine can “understand.”
That translation is done by a program called a compiler. 

To compile a c++ programme you can either use c++ or g++ (instead of gcc in C). For example:

  [ g++ hello.cpp -o hello ]

To execute this program you can just write: ./hello (name of the exectuable) on your terminal.



<h2> Variables <h2>

It's juste like in C. 

int i = 0;
float i = 10.0; etc.


<h2> Standard input & output library <h2>

In order to use some useful variables that will allow us to interact with the terminal, we need to include a library:
#include <iostream>

This will allow us to use std::cout, std::cin or even more things :) Here is an example:


int main() {
  
  double tempf;
  double tempc;
  
  std::cout << "What's the temp in Fahrenheit ? ";        //asking the user for the temp
  std::cin >> tempf;                                      //will put the input in the tempf variable
  
  tempc = (tempf - 32) / 1.8;
  
  std::cout << "The temp is " << tempc << " degrees Celsius.\n";  //printing the temp in celsius in the terminal (output)
  
}
