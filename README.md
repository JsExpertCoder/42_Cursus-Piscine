Welcome to my GitHub repository!

Here, you will find all the projects completed during my journey at 42, an innovative coding school renowned for its peer-to-peer learning environment and emphasis on practical programming skills.

All of my projects completed at 42 can be found within this repository. These projects cover a wide range of topics and technologies, showcasing my growth as a programmer throughout the program. I coded mainly in C and C++ but I also did some projects on Virtual Machines and by using Docker for example. 

## My Gitbook
In addition to my project submissions, I've created comprehensive guides detailing my methodology, logic, and approach to solving the challenges presented in each project. These guides serve as valuable resources for fellow students within the 42 network, offering insights and strategies to navigate their own projects successfully.

## Feedbacks
I've received valuable feedback from individuals around the globe on my gitbook, which has helped refine my understanding and approach to coding challenges. I'm grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the knowledge-sharing culture at 42 and beyond.

Feel free to explore my projects and guides, and I hope they prove helpful in your own coding journey !
